Anton Belyaev

Technical Lead

As a dedicated and passionate developer, I thrive on designing innovative applications and crafting high-quality code. My enthusiasm particularly lies in Test-Driven Development (TDD) and the Testing Trophy approach.

My main tech stack includes Java, Spring Boot, and Kafka. I am passionate about TDD and the Testing Trophy approach, with a preference for integration tests. In recent years, my efforts have been focused on improving the testing experience within the Spring Boot. My publications on industry-specific platforms describe practices for improving this experience.
