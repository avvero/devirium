Тема ведения заметок в последнее время стала популярной.

Представьте что вы ведет заметки, ваша база наполняется, граф растет, все прекрасно и чудесно, а что дальше? А том что дальше я бы хотел рассказать в этой статье.

Много прекрасных статей рассказывают о том как вести заметки 
А что дальше? Делиться ими! 

В статье я расскажу о том, что такое сад, из чего его растить, зачем нужно делиться и как это делать.

Заметки в цифровой сад. Заметки отлично для этого подходят, потому что они по своей сути представляю собой не набор отполированных статьей к публикации, а скорее 

## Мой случай, мои заметки, как я веду заметки

Всем привет, хочу поделиться своим опытом и рассказать о концепции цифрового сада, с которой недавно познакомился.  

Узнал от https://github.com/rwxrob на твиче.

Последние три года веду заметки в стиле Zettelkasten (на сколько я его понял и принял к использованию). Заметки в виде md файлов храню в git репозитории. На компьютере работаю с ними в VSCode, на телефоне использую стандартное приложение "Заметки". Почему не Obsidian? У меня около 1000 заметок, и каждый раз, когда открываю приложение на iPhone, Obsidian может до минуты синхронизироваться, возможно из-за конфликта с git метаданными. Мне нужно быстрое приложение заметок, чтобы записывать мысли на ходу. Использование отдельного приложения на телефоне имеет плюс — при переносе в md файлы я лишний раз пересматриваю заметку и лучше запоминаю написанное. Перенос заметки из одной условной "папки" в другую это часто повторяющийся паттерн работы с материалом, который я видел много где, начиная от Джедайских Техник Дорофеева, до Библии комедии (ты уверен?)

Моя коллекция заметок = In this collection, you’ll find code snippets, review materials, and sometimes just headers as reminders to revisit topics. It mainly covers software engineering, with a few snippets in Java and Go. You’ll also find philosophy from the Hellenes (a fancy way to say “ancient Greeks”), silly jokes, and other interesting things I’ve encountered. Most of it is in Russian, with some in English.

## Что такое цифровой сад

>My small collection highlighted a number of sites that are taking a new approach to the way we publish personal knowledge on the web.
>They're not following the conventions of the "personal blog," as we've come to know it. Rather than presenting a set of polished articles, displayed in reverse chronological order, these sites act more like free form, work-in-progress wikis.
>Caufield makes clear digital gardening is not about specific tools – it's not a Wordpress plugin, Gastby theme, or Jekyll template. It's a different way of thinking about our online behaviour around information - one that accumulates personal knowledge over time in an explorable space.
>Gardens present information in a richly linked landscape that grows slowly over time.
>Everything is arranged and connected in ways that allow you to explore.
>Joel focused on the process of digital gardening, emphasising the slow growth of ideas through writing, rewriting, editing, and revising thoughts in public. Instead of slapping Fully Formed Opinions up on the web and never changing them.

The goal of digital gardening should be to tap into your network’s collective intelligence to create constructive feedback loops. If done well, I have a shareable representation of my thoughts that I can send out into the world and people can respond. Even for my most half-baked thoughts, this helps me create a feedback cycle to strengthen and fully flesh out that idea.

>Не одноразовые
>Вeчноцветущие 

> The phrase "digital garden" is a metaphor for thinking about writing and creating that focuses less on the resulting "showpiece" and more on the process, care, and craft it takes to get there. While not everybody has or works in a dirt garden, we all share a familiarity with the idea of what a garden is.
>A garden is usually a place where things grow.
>Gardens can be very personal and full of whimsy or a garden can be a source of food and substance.

The Six Patterns of Gardening
1. Topography over Timelines. Gardens are organised around contextual relationships and associative links; the concepts and themes within each note determine how it's connected to others. Gardens don't consider publication dates the most important detail of a piece of writing. Dates might be included on posts, but they aren't the structural basis of how you navigate around the garden.
2. Continuous Growth. Gardens are never finished, they're constantly growing, evolving, and changing. Just like a real soil, carrot, and cabbage garden.
3. Imperfection & Learning in Public. Gardens are imperfect by design. They don't hide their rough edges or claim to be a permanent source of truth.
4. Playful, Personal, and Experimental. Gardens are non-homogenous by nature. You can plant the same seeds as your neighbour, but you'll always end up with a different arrangement of plants. You organise the garden around the ideas and mediums that match your way of thinking, rather than off someone else's standardised template.
5. Intercropping & Content Diversity
6. Independent Ownership. Gardening is about claiming a small patch of the web for yourself, one you fully own and control.

"Digital Garden" is a philosophy for sharing personal knowledge on the web:
- Gardens are organized around contextual relationships and associative links.
- Gardens are never finished; they're constantly growing, evolving, and changing.
- Gardens are imperfect by design. They don't hide their rough edges or claim to be a permanent source of truth.
- Gardens are meant to be shared.

## Зачем делиться / Learning in Public

Open Source Your Knowledge

Зачем это мне. 
1. Мне нравится как другие ведут сады, мне интересно их читать, я хотел бы делать так же.
2. Publishing imperfect and early ideas requires that we make the status of our notes clear to readers.
3. A habit of creating learning exhaust. Whatever your thing is, make the thing you wish you had found when you were learning. https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public

## Как делиться

The current state of web development helped here too. While it feels like we've been in a slow descent into a horrifyingly complex and bloated web development process, a number of recent tools have made it easier to get a fully customised website up and running. Services like Netlify and Vercel have taken the pain out of deployment. Static site generators like Jekyll, Gatsby, 11ty and Next make it easier to build sophisticated websites that auto-generate pages, and take care of grunt work like optimising load time, images, and SEO.

These services are trying to find a happy middle ground between tediously hand-coding solutions, and being trapped in the restrictions of Wordpress or Squarespace.

Tools like Obsidian, TiddlyWiki, and Notion are all great options. Many of them offer fancy features like nested folders, Bi-Directional Links, footnotes, and visual graphs.

However, many of these no-code tools still feel like cookie-cutter solutions. Rather than allowing people to design the information architecture and spatial layouts of their gardens, they inevitably force people into pre-made arrangements. This doesn't meant they don't "count,” as "real” gardens, but simply that they limit their gardeners to some extent. You can't design different types of links, novel features, experimental layouts, or custom architecture. They're pre-fab houses instead of raw building materials.

Для себя я выбрал кварц.

From [Philosophy of Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/philosophy)

Quartz is designed first and foremost as a tool for publishing digital gardens to the web. To me, digital gardening is not just passive knowledge collection. It’s a form of expression and sharing.

## Мой цифровой сад

Недавно я открыл для себя концепцию цифрового сада — философию делиться личными знаниями в интернете. Сады постоянно растут, изменяются и предназначены для общего доступа. Подробнее можно почитать здесь https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history. Вдохновившись этой концепцией, я создал свой цифровой сад — https://devirium.avvero.pw и опубликовал все свои заметки. Также создал канал в Телеграме: https://t.me/devirium, куда синхронизируются все заметки. Использую его как средство доступа — Телеграм часто открыт, он очень быстрый и есть поиск по тегам. Раз в день туда прилетает случайная заметка, которую я читаю и вспоминаю. На главной странице сада приведена дизайн схема и все компоненты, если вы захотите сделать себе подобное.

## References and Further Reading

У концепции есть философия и история, я не буду их пересказывать, лишь представлю ссылки на то, где про это можно почитать подбронее - https://maggieappleton.com.
