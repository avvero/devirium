## Персонажи

Генерале, он явно не называется архитектором, но в разговоре про него говорят как «архитектор сражения»

Архитектор видит как три солдата тащат ящик с патронами, им тяжело и очевидно, что достаточно четвёртого человека, чтобы донести ящик. Архитектор предлагает разные идеи как им помочь кроме самого очевидного - стать 4 человеком

## Стиль

Нравится, как нарисованы персонажи российской игры с ПК Петька и Василий Иванович

## Рисуем

Comic strip, 4 panels.

Panel 1: comic panel showing one exhausted soldier struggling with a large ammunition box. His face should be comically strained, uniforms disheveled. 

Panel 2: comic panel showing a general giving an elaborate presentation. He stands near a blackboard covered with obvious diagrams showing "1+1=2". The two tired soldiers sit on ammunition boxes, looking confused.

Panel 3: comic panel showing two! soldiers easily carrying the same ammunition box, walking past the proud general.

Panel 4: comic panel showing a ceremony where the general receives a medal. The commander's chest is already full of medals, and he's giving a speech about it. Include a banner reading "За выдающиеся заслуги в области военной логистики".

Style for all panels:
- Style matches "Петька и Василий Иванович" games with exaggerated expressions and hand-painted look. Setting: dusty military camp, 1918-1920.
- Hand-painted look of 90s Russian adventure games
- Rich colors and exaggerated character designs
- Detailed backgrounds with Civil War era elements
- Humorous tone matching Petka & Chapaev games

Style for all panels:

- Heavy outlines, hand-painted textures, warm earthy color palette
- Visual humor and grotesque exaggeration in characters' faces and body proportions
- Backgrounds painted in watercolor-like detail with visible brush texture
- Stylized Civil War era tents, signs with Cyrillic text, red flags, and rustic forest/military camp scenery
- Comedic and absurdist tone, slightly surreal, parodying military seriousness
- Each panel must have visual punchline or exaggerated comic beat
- Characters with over-the-top expressions: bulging eyes, twisted mouths, exaggerated mustaches
- Uniforms distorted for comic effect: too tight or too baggy
- Comical poses, dynamic movement, odd anatomy reminiscent of Soviet cartoon satire
