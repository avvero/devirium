# Digital garden

>Не одноразовые
>Вeчноцветущие 

> The phrase "digital garden" is a metaphor for thinking about writing and creating that focuses less on the resulting "showpiece" and more on the process, care, and craft it takes to get there. While not everybody has or works in a dirt garden, we all share a familiarity with the idea of what a garden is.
>A garden is usually a place where things grow.
>Gardens can be very personal and full of whimsy or a garden can be a source of food and substance.
