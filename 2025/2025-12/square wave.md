Square wave has a fundamental of 100Hz. The second harmonic — at 200Hz — is absent, but the third harmonic lies at 300Hz and has an amplitude of a third of the fundamental. Similarly, the fourth harmonic is absent, but the fifth is present at 500Hz and has an amplitude of one-fifth... and so on. All the harmonics are in phase, and the waveform looks like that shown in Figure.
