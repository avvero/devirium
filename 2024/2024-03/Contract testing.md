# Contract testing

The problem that initiative aims to address revolves around the challenges and intricacies involved in integration testing, especially when dealing with microservices or external APIs. Integration testing, which verifies that different parts of a system work together as intended, can become highly complex and cumbersome when multiple services are involved. The contract testing approach proposes a solution to these challenges by focusing on verifying the interactions between services at the API level based on predefined contracts. 

Required to dive into contract testing and say what we can achieve.
