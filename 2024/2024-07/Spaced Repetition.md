When we learn something new, we are using our working memory. Our working memory is like a so-so blackboard with limited capacity to hold four [Chunks](https://til.yenly.wtf/notes/chunks). To move these chunks into long term memory, we need [Delibrate Practice](https://til.yenly.wtf/notes/delibrate-practice) using [Recall](https://til.yenly.wtf/notes/recall) method. Spaced repetition technique is to spread out our repeating practices over a number of days to build stronger neural structures.

Learning and relearning is the way to set it into longer-term memory storage.
