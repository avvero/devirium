Cohesion is the degree to which the elements inside a module belong together. A module could be a class or a package or even a microservice. Simply put, it means “the code that changes together, stays together”.

Coupling is the degree of interdependence between software modules. A module could be a class or a package or even a microservice. Effectively, the coupling is about how changing one thing required change in another.
