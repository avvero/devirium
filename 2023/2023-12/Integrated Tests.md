# Integrated Tests

Взято из [[Testing of Microservices]].

A test that will pass or fail based on the correctness of another system.

Some signs of having Integrated Tests are:

We spin up other services in a local testing environment
We test against other services in a shared testing environment
Changes to your system breaks tests for other systems
This is a quite fragile way of testing and we recommend learning more directly from the source above.
