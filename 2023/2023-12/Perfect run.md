# Perfect run

Один из самых интересных опытов при решении проблем на leetcode это "Perfect run". Я слышал этот термин в подобной формулировке "when you are in a full flow and feeling totally unstoppable" от Barney Stinson. 

И это действительно занятно, когда ты 50 минут думаешь над проблемой и потом в течении 10 минут пишешь нонстоп код сложного алгоритма и с первой попытки система принимает твое решение и дает высокий рейтинг. Это прикольно, вам стоит попробовать.

Perfect Run

One of the most exhilarating experiences I've encountered in problem-solving on LeetCode is what I like to call a "Perfect Run". This term reminds me of something Barney Stinson once described as being "in a full flow and feeling totally unstoppable".

Imagine this: you spend 50 minutes meticulously pondering over a complex problem. Then, in a burst of clarity, you spend the next 10 minutes in an uninterrupted flow, coding out a sophisticated algorithm. And the cherry on top? Your solution works on the first try and earns a high score from the system.

This whole process is not just fulfilling, but also pretty cool. It's something I think everyone should try at least once.

Perfect Run: The Thrill of Problem-Solving on LeetCode

One of the most exhilarating experiences I've encountered in problem-solving on LeetCode is what I like to call a "Perfect Run". This term reminds me of something Barney Stinson once described as being "in a full flow and feeling totally unstoppable".

Imagine this: you spend 50 minutes meticulously pondering over a complex problem.

It's a genuinely thrilling experience, blending deep analytical thinking with a rush of coding adrenaline. If you haven't experienced this "Perfect Run" on LeetCode, I highly recommend giving it a try. It's not just about solving problems; it's about the journey of getting there, which is both challenging and incredibly rewarding.
