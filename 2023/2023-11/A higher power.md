Из [[The Daily Stoic]]

«It’s about attuning to the universe and discarding the toxic idea that we’re at the center of it.»
«You don’t have to believe there is a god directing the universe, you just need to stop believing that you’re that director. As soon as you can attune your spirit to that idea, the easier and happier your life will be, because you will have given up the most potent addiction of all: control.»
