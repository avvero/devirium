Counterintuitively, we found CI times between 15-30 minutes correspond to the highest number of PRs merged per week per author. This graph shows that engineers with average CI run times around the 15-30 minute mark have the highest output in terms of number of PRs merged.

Teams centered in the middle of this curve are most typical of high-performing, well-staffed teams with more complex products and optimized CI infrastructure.
