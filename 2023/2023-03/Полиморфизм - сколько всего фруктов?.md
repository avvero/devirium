Есть три яблока и два апельсина, сколько всего фруктов?

Полиморфизм операции сложения.

```
Yes, this is an example of polymorphism,
In computer science, it's a form of realism,
Where a method or function can have multiple forms,
Based on the data type that is being transformed.

In the case of addition, it's not just for numbers,
It works for strings, lists, and other wonders,
Where the operation is defined for each type,
And the output is adjusted to make it right.

So, whether you're adding integers or fruit,
The concept of polymorphism is astute,
It allows for flexibility and ease,
And makes programming a breeze.
