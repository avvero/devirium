Comic strip, 3 panels. Panel 1: A mother and her child sit at a kitchen table. The mother, smiling gently, says in Russian: ‘Съешь оскорбинку!’ with strong emphasis on the ‘О’ in ‘оскорбинку’. The child frowns and replies: ‘Не хочу.’ Panel 2: On the table, a round tablet with arms and legs suddenly comes to life. It looks furious, shaking its fists. Panel 3: The tablet (personified) is angrily yelling at the child: ‘Ах ты мелкая непослушная мерзавка!’ The style is bright, cartoonish, and expressive. Emphasize the absurdity and the wordplay.
