The Raft algorithm is a consensus algorithm designed to manage a replicated log. It is used to ensure that multiple servers (or nodes) in a distributed system agree on a consistent state, which is crucial for fault-tolerance and reliability. Raft is often favored for its simplicity and understandability compared to other consensus algorithms like Paxos.
