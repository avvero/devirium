## Atomicity 

## Consistency

transaction can only bring the database from one valid state to another.

From [[Designing Data-Intensive Applications ]]: «The idea of ACID consistency is that you have certain statements about your data ([[Invariant]]) that must always be true—for example, in an accounting system, credits and debits across all accounts must always be balanced. If a transaction starts with a database that is valid according to these invariants, and any writes during the transaction preserve the validity, then you can be sure that the invariants are always satisfied.»
