BFF is a variant of API gateway pattern. Instead of having only one API gateway sitting between UI layer and backend microservices, BFF offers dedicated gateway for different types of clients. For example, data consumption by a mobile UI could be different from data consumption by a browser. In that case, for better data representation, two BFFs can be used.
